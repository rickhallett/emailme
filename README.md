# Emailme

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Run

`yarn dev-all`

Todo:

1. Link UI config to controller/service/persistance
2. Link email creation to controller/service/?persistance
3. Does using Sqlite allow for an easy switch to elastic? Does Nodemailer interact with elastic out of the box? Abstract DB persistance for swappable approach.
